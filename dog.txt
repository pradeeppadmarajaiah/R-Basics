The domestic dog (Canis lupus familiaris or Canis familiaris)[4] is a member of genus Canis (canines) that forms part of the wolf-like canids,[5] and is the most widely abundant carnivore.[6][7][8] The dog and the extant gray wolf are sister taxa,[9][10][11] with modern wolves not closely related to the wolves that were first domesticated.[10][11] The dog was the first domesticated species[11][12] and has been selectively bred over millennia for various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes.
